		<h1>Teaching Assistant Slides for CISC 181: Highlights</h1>
        <p>
            Below are some of my favorite slides that I made for CISC 181.

        <h3>The Method Signature</h3>

        <p>
            This was me describing the Java method signature. There are a lot of diagrams like this online, but I like the one I made. It is cleaner, more concise, and easier to understand than other versions online.
        </p>
        <h3>Java Types</h3>

        <p>
            Again, there were a lot of diagrams like this online that were bad. I felt this combined many of them into one useful image.
