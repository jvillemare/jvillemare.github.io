						<p>
							Hello! I am James Villemarette, and welcome to my portfolio for my ENGL 410 (Technical Writing) course that I took at the University of Delaware in Spring of 2021. Over the course of many tumultuous, Zoom meeting, COVID online months, I was fortunate enough to be taught about the intricacies of Technical Communication by my Professor, Zdenek. Largely, what I learned was how to communicate full and concise thoughts, which I always thought would be mutually exclusive. Being thorough and brief is not as impossible as I once previously thought.
						</p>
						<p>
							I hope that, below, you enjoy all of the work I did in the semester. I have very carefully arranged and manicured this page to be pleasant to look at and scroll through. Many painstaking hours of care went behind every section you see. I am still in the process of revising other parts of my personal website here, but I think the aesthetic I have acheived here is something good.

						<p>
							For our first portfolio prompt, we were given the following directions:  Search the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/" target="_blank" title="Click this link to open it in a new page.">r/specializedtools subreddit &#10138;</a>, and find two tools.  Then, for each tool, we were to write a description, explaining its function and appearance to someone who may have never seen it before. Then, we were to reflect on what techniques we used in each paragraph explanation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Try reading one paragraph below, then click on its accompanying link (in the sub-bulletpoints) to see if it makes sense. Did it look like what you expected?

									<b>Portable High-rise Apartment Moving Elevator Vehicle</b>
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Imagine if you had to move into a high-rise apartment -- that does not have an elevator -- in a narrow street, how would you go about it? Your best bet is to raise your heavy furniture or other goods with a Portable Vehicle Delivery Elevator. It is hitched and towed with your moving truck. When you arrive at your destination, strong stabilizers are extended along each side of the elevator, and make contact with the road at an acute angle, which helps keep the elevator stable. Then, like a fireman‚Äôs ladder, the backbone of the elevator extends to the window of your apartment. Then, a flat, seat-like car goes up the backbone to your apartment window, where your furniture and goods can be easily moved in. Then, the car goes back down the backbone to pick up more goods. The reverse of this process happens for if or when you move out.</li>
									<ul>

										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Reflection:</b> My approach here for this second specialized tool was to explain it like I would to a friend. Hooking them in with why you would need it. Then some technical description followed by analogies of backbone and firemen‚Äôs ladder. I think the more informal explanation here helps.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
								<p class="mb-1">
									<b>Bubble Wrap Making Machine</b>
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>This machine creates bubble wrap from a single roll of double-layer plastic, filling air in equidistant spots, and sealing the wrap with heat to form another roll of bubble bubble wrap. The machine uses two rollers, one where it pulls the double-layer plastic from, and the other where the final product of bubble wrap is stored. The plastic wrap goes through a few rollers, where first air is injected by one of 13 air tubes, and then immediately sealed by another roller that is heated. The rollers are just cylinders that are anchored on one side. It operates by itself until the source plastic is emptied. The machine itself is not in a protected enclosure, and so the plastic is just slotted in, like magnetic tape in a player, or like the tape in a cassette.</li>
									<ul>

											<b>Source:</b> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/m5224j/this_bubble_wrap_machine/" target="_blank" title="Click this link to open it in a new page.">"This Bubble Wrap Machine" by The_Tech_Monkey on reddit &#10138;</a>.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b>Reflection:</b> My main strategy in the above explanation is to work through the steps of the process, as well as increase the depth of the explanations in each new sentence. I also used imagery and analogy to describe the machine. Rereading it myself, outloud, I think it makes sense.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>

						<p class="mb-5">
							Personally, I feel as if my explanation for the Personal Elevator Vehicle is better, as it's easier to relate to a firetruck's ladder system, which most people have seen, one way or another.

							How can we make the instructions for accessible self-serve gas pumps easier to read, see, and understand? Accessible gas pumps are the law under the ADA. Note that a gas station can choose how the patron should signal to get the attendant‚Äôs attention. Honking is one option. Technical documents should be concise and usable (scannable, accessible, readable), and this Shell has none of those qualities.

							What I had done was move the important information to the top.  If a fire is starting, no one is going to read through several paragraphs of text to the 4.5th bullet point, to find a tiny 12 pt font text saying "<small>If a fire starts, do not remove the nozzle</small>". That's just ridiculous.

						<p>
							Other changes I did include
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>removing fluff text.</li>
							<li>adding more icons (all of which are royalty free).</li>
							<li>using the more <a href="https://accessibleicon.org/">modern and progressive ADA logo (of the moving handi-capable person)</a>.</li>

									For this data visualization prompt, I chose the gender stratification data for my College of Engineering at the University of Delaware. I chose this data set because it's relevant strongly to my major of Computer Science, which is infamously male-dominated. And I think it's important to recognize that we certainly need more women in STEM overall, as a diversity of people and ideas only benefits everyone.
								</p>
								<p>
									I create two different charts, one bar <b>clustered columns</b> graph and one <b>stacked area</b> graph. Due to the nature of the numerical data over time, there are limited options for what graphs I could do. The second graph is interesting to see the relationship literally stacked on top of each other. But I found the first graph to be more compelling, especially with the trend line that clearly shows the number of women in our College of Engineering increasing over time. Overall, this was interesting to see graph, and I think it's a good trend for our college, and society as a whole.

							This menu did honestly take me about an hour to fix. In a weird way, it is overwhelming the number of problems there are with it. The first distraction that I had to fix was the hard-to-read center alignment, and the stray bullet points everywhere. I retyped all of the menu's content into Word and fiddled around with it for a while. After looking for inspiration on Canva, I decided it was easier to come up with my own font pairings to uniquely convey the menu. I chose Montserrat for "Saturday Specials", since it is easy to read, and gave it a lot of spacing to be prominent. Then, I realized there were some discounted menu items scattered throughout the original menu that could be isolated in one column. I chose progressively narrower font weights of Futura for the "Discounts" heading, then lighter font weight for the menu item, and again lighter weight for the sides.
						</p>
						<p>
							All in all, while this portfolio item does not appear to be much, I think it works well. It is easily extensible to tack on "Sunday Specials" without printing a whole new page (since Saturday's Specials takes up less than half the page). And it is easily maintainable and readable.

											In places around our country, making orange juice makes a lot of money.  But there is a bad bug inside of the orange trees that are making them sick.  It's like cooties, one tree gets it, and then spreads it to the other trees.  This is very bad.  This could make all the oranges and orange juice go away forever.  Some smart people know how to fix this, but it is weird.  They have to go inside the orange trees and change them.  They have to change the blueprints of the trees to protect them from the cooties.  But other people like you and me are scared of the oranges being different.  These smart people have only changed the blueprints of other fruits a few times before.  We should be happy about protecting the trees from the cooties.  But we also have to know about the risks of changing the tree's blueprint.

							Yet again, I find the most powerful tool for reducing a complex topic for younger audiences is by analogies. Cooties are admittedly an immature concept, but they are a powerful reference point for younger audiences to understand how viruses and diseases transmit. Explaining what a virus is, directly, would be difficult because it just is what it is, and it can be a weird concept. "What, you're just telling me us two being close together is dangerous?! Poppycock!" etc. The harder concept to get across here is gene editing, and I think the repetition helped drive the point of it home.

									This picture is one of my finest that I've taken in the past few years. It was the Naypyidaw Zoological Gardens in Burma (Myanmar). I took the photo with a Sony NEX-5, and there is absolutely no post processing on this image, just the raw JPEG. I am very jazzed about that.

									The first two colors that I chose are monochromatic variants of tan, eye dropper picked from the eponymous lioness. The next two are also monochromatic variants from the foremost tree. The last color is green from the foreground short grass. I picked these colors because I think they are pleasing earth tones that make up the majority of the image. And the colors are somewhat muted, and there's so many bright color palettes out there in the world that I think a more "down to earth" (ha) one can be appreciated.

							The purpose of this assignment was to explain the same technical topic to three different audiences using words and images. It's inspired by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/" target="_blank">the subreddit group Explain like I'm five &#10138;</a>, and Randall Monroe‚Äôs book <i>Thing Explainer</i> (which explains technical topics with his drawings and only the "ten hundred words people use most"). We had to choose a technical or specialized topic that we know well and could research further. And we had to write this technical description or technical definition for three different audiences. One young audience (5th grade or below), one audience of our choice (I chose college students), and the third audience was <a href="https://splasho.com/upgoer5/" target="_blank" title="Link opens in a new tab">using the top 10,000 most used words, limited by the up-goer five text editor &#10138;</a>.

    What is my fascination with heat pumps? They may just the old/new invention
that can help save the world from climate change. They use a fraction of the
energy of electric heating in homes, while also moving more energy. And the
best part is that they are reversible. So, they can cool a home in the
summer, and warm it up in the winter.
    My three audiences were for young kids (about fifth grade level), college
students (undergraduates), and the top ten hundred words list (UpGooer5). The
young kids audience is the one I started working on first. In hindsight, I
should‚Äôve worked on the most complex audience first (College Students), then
move progressively down to the easier (young kids) then easier audience (top ten
hundred). Starting with the young kids though wasn‚Äôt the worst option.
    I found the top ten hundred words audience the most difficult to work with.
It is so limiting, and there‚Äôs not a lot of ways to relate the action of the
heat pumps in about 400 words, or around that. I mean, you can rework the words
into the UpGooer5 textbox, but the meaning and what it actually does is
substantially lost. I understand that‚Äôs the point, but I just wanted to clearly
state that I ran into a lot of trouble with it.
    My main strategy was to relate the processes occurring using analogies. For
the younger kids, I kept using the same analogy of ice cubes and stoves and
radiating heat because a consistent analogy would most likely help a younger
audience. Instead of switching to a different analogy for every part, I think a
consistent analogy really helped. For the college students, I mainly just
assumed a basic high school education and vocabulary, and tried relating the
‚Äúhigher‚Äù, more complex processes.
    Overall, this was a very interesting assignment. I did spend a lot of time
on the design, and couldn‚Äôt dedicate as much time as I‚Äôd like to special
formatting, bolding, and underlining of the text. I hope the flow of it makes
sense. I made sure the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 layout made sense.</pre>

    My audience for this bird house user instructions manual was for any
hobbyist or bird enthusiast wondering how to build a bird house. I, myself, am
infatuated with Crows, all American, Hooded, African, and the like. I do
regularly subscribe to r/Crows and follow any new pictures or research
developments in the avian world. And I want to think that I understand the best
bird house who wants to build a bird house is most likely over 20 years of age
and has accessed to a Home Depot or basic woodworking equipment and lumber to
build a bird house.
    I approached my topic by researching existing guides from the Audubon
Society and Cornell Ornithology, and what tips and recommendations they make. I
tried my best to understand the instructions, as I do not have the time or
resources to test them, as much as I would like to. And for my inspired version,
I followed this Dishwasher Manual, along with many other appliance manuals that
I‚Äôve encountered in my lifetime. I found the monochrome look, simple 3D
renderings, gray header boxes, and rounded fonts of Helvetica and Arial to be a
style I wanted to emulate.
    It took some time to build the 3D renders, and the initial inspired layout
in Adobe Illustrator, but I think I achieved an honestly novel‚Äîemphasis on
new‚Äîset of instructions on how to build bird houses. Using a 3D model that is
kept mostly the same between pages as much as possible helps visualize where
the screws and cutouts need to go.
    The specific need that I am addressing is a simple, rugged, large font-size
manual that could easily be sent along in a bird house making kit. Assuming the
wood is precut, and the receiver just must drill screws in, they could easily
read the table of contents on the second page and flip to the screw diagram.
And it works from starting from scratch. Or, as a quick reference.
    And I tried my best to make the original version as inventive as possible
with a different layout, coordinate flat color scheme, and some shortened
descriptions. It took about 15 hours on the first inspired version. The second
original version condenses a lot of the information down from the first (it was
one of the suggestions in my peer review), with the same changes I listed two
sentences ago. I hope it is okay if I used the same images for both. I hope the
effort comes across.</pre>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p class="mb-5">
							Overall, I think this assignment turned out really well. I am not the most proficient user of Blender, and it took me a few hours to make the basic bird house model that went into most of the slides. But I think the 3D renders turned out well and useful with all that shading. And I think it's a compelling bird house assembly manual.

    I designed the home page of our website, single handedly.  First, I took an
image from the MHV launch meeting, and I used it because I think it looked very
professional and clean.  Because of the white text for the ‚ÄúIn Delaware‚Äù and nav
links--and because of GoDaddy‚Äôs limitations--I had to add a black gradient to
the top and bottom of the meeting image to make the text readable.  I also added
a Call to Action button, with a ‚ÄúSee Our Community Partners‚Äù button because that
seems to be what most users would want to know.  Most users would likely want to
know where to get medical support through their local community partners.  About
70% of small business websites do not have a Call to Action button, which can be
useful for new users [1].
    My next big decision was to include the mission statement, history, and
program report highlights and full program reports on the homepage.  About 50%
of users to a website do not click into another page of a website [2].
This means most users will only see the homepage.  Every time a user has to
click to a new page, they are less likely to see other pages of the website,
even if a website provides a really important product or service they need.  So,
I believe having all this information on the front page (reorganized and
condensed) is beneficial for the user experience.  The mission statement could
have been edited to be less vague, and the history section could be trimmed down
and highlight their accomplishments better.  But I wanted to preserve
Christine‚Äôs writing as is, since that‚Äôs something core and critical to the
website that you would want to work directly with the client to improve it.
    Overall, I think the changes I did on the homepage were substantial and
mostly effective.  I think the photo choices are better.  And had there been
more time, I would have revised all of the writing on the website.  But as it
stands, I think it‚Äôs a large improvement on the original HealthForAll site.</pre>

    For our last project, I am very jazzed to be doing a tutorial, and I am
jazzed in how well it turned out.  My original recording was about 30 minutes in
length.  My first cut trimmed it down to 12:30, then 11:30, then 7:29.  After
reading some suggestions from my peer reviews, I realized some steps were more
complicated than they needed to be.  And after replacing two overly long steps
(you can tell where the cuts are based on when a clip has a suddenly, quieter
voice over), I was able to trim down my video to 5:54 in length.  I realize that
is really stretching the ‚Äúabout 5 minutes‚Äù maximum time limit requirement in the
instructions, but my video is on a complex topic.
    In retrospect, I probably should have chosen an easier topic.  I was worried
about choosing a topic too niche or too easy to cover.  But!  To be fair, no one
has ever covered my topic (as far as I can tell with Google search results), and
almost all students in my other classes use OCR‚Äôd PDFs, all the time.  In my
Philosophy classes, I am using an OCR PDF of our textbooks to search for quotes,
authors, and other critical lines.  And I do not need to speak ad nauseum about
the obvious time saving benefits of that.
    It has taken me about a year to discover the method I present in the video.
First, it took me months to understand that Tesseract only works on images to
produce a single OCR PDF.  Then, ImageMagick is a great utility to convert
non-OCR PDFs to images for Tesseract.  But the ImageMagick website does not say
that it needs GhostScript, but it does need it to run, and it throws a cryptic
error message if you do not have it.  Then, I had to find a Python library to
combine the individual OCR PDF pages into one, combined OCR PDF, and write a
script (myself) to put it all together.
    Other people have used Tesseract and made tutorials on it, but no one has
fully connected the dots on how to take a normal PDF and make it to a full OCR
PDF.  I think this will be massively helpful to anyone that finds it.  I will
leave it published on YouTube at this link [1].  You can monitor how well (or
bad) it does in ratings and views.
    In terms of the YouTutorial guidance, I think I hit accessibility,
viewability, accuracy, completeness, and pertinence.  My confidence could be
better by having smoother speaking tone, and not having my microphone maxed
most of the time.  Timing was a little rough in some parts where drastic edits
had to be done.  But otherwise, I think it is watchable.  I use a heavy amount
of zooms, pans, highlights, and text overlays to not overload a viewer, but to
give just the right amount of information.  Additionally, on YouTube, I was
able to add in timecodes, so in the progress or timeline bar, you will see it is
fragmented based on section of the video that you are in.  You can even click
where it says ‚ÄúIntroduction >‚Äù or ‚ÄúGhostScript >‚Äù and see the other chapters,
or just open the description and see the timecodes.
    [Screenshot of video description].
    Pasted above is the description that I put on YouTube.
    My intended audience is for people with little to no technical knowledge
installing all the software necessary to make an easy, automatic OCR application
on their computer.  And while I am biased and in Computer Science, and I would
say the tutorial is fairly thorough, it will be interesting to see how
non-computer minded folks fair with the instructions.
    Anyhow, thank you for a great semester, Professor Zdenek, and I hope you
have a great summer!</pre>

							I will try to not reiterate too much of what I said in my Reflective Memo, above: I like how it turned out! I did face some difficulty using VEGAS Pro Edit 15 as opposed to the recommended ActivePresenter. VEGAS Pro Edit is really meant for camera video as opposed to screen recordings, but I found (the recommended screen recording and editing software) ActivePresenter a little too restricting, and I am more familiar with VEGAS.
