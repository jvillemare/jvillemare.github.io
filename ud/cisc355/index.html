        <h1>My notes on Computer Ethics</h1>
        <p>
            These are my notes from the textbook: <i>Ethics for the Information Age</i> (8 th Ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson. Author: Quinn, M. J., (2019).
        </p>
		<p>
			I found that Chapter 2 is vital to understanding the rest of the book. And these notes were very helpful to me in my other philosophy courses I took.

Introduction to Ethics
○ <b id="introduction">2.1: <mark>Introduction</mark></b>
	§ A family can live on their own, but a community of families can specialize in certain tasks of farming,
        textiles, carpentry, road-paving, etc.
	§ "Advantages of community life outweigh the disadvantages [of a community setting certain prohibitions
        and obligations.]"
	§ This chapter will focus on ethical theories and logical argumentation to solve the problems of a
        community when multiple people are impact negatively and positively.
○ <b id="subjective_relativism">2.2: <mark>Subjective Relativism: What I deem moral is correct</mark></b>
	§ Case For
		□ Well-meaning and intelligent people can have totally opposite opinions about moral issues.
		□ Ethical debates are disagreeable and pointless.
	§ Case Against
		□ Useless when comparing the actions of different people.
		□ It's not reason based.
		□ What you do vs what you say is different.
○ <b id="cultural_relativism">2.3: <mark>Cultural Relativism: What society deems moral is correct</mark></b>
	§ Case For
		□ Different social contexts demand different moral guidelines.
		□ It is arrogant for one society to judge another.
	§ Case Against
		□ Just because two societies have different views doesn't mean they have to have different views.
		□ How do you determine these "society guidelines"? They're usually informally and hard to discern.
			® See Japan
		□ Groups within a society can still disagree.
		□ Doesn't work between different cultures.
		□ Just because it's culturally acceptable doesn't mean it's acceptable.
		□ Indirectly based on reason.
○ <b id="divine_command_theory">2.4: <mark>Divine Command Theory: What god deems moral is correct</mark></b>
	§ Case For
		□ We owe obedience to our Creator.
		□ God is all-good and all-knowing, the ultimate authority.
	§ Case Against
		□ Holy books disagree with each other
		□ Unrealistic to assume a multicultural society will adopt a religion-based morality.
			® See United States.
		□ Moral problems not addressed directly in scripture.
		□ Based on obedience, not reason.
○ <b id="ethical_egoism">2.5: <mark>Ethical Egoism: What's best for me is morally correct</mark></b>
	§ Case For
		□ It's a practical moral philosophy.
			® Instead of sacrificing your own well-being for other people, it recognizes we should focus on
                ourselves.
		□ Other people should take care of themselves.
		□ Communities benefit when individuals put their well-being first
			® See entrepreneurs.
		□ Other moral principles are rooted in self-interest.
			® You wouldn't want to lie because then you'll be seen as a liar and no one will trust/work with
                you.
	§ Case Against
		□ Easy moral philosophies may not be the best moral philosophy.
		□ We know what's good for others; we should help them.
		□ Self-interest can slippery slop to immoral behavior.
		□ Backwards and degrading way of evaluating every action.
			® Should I save this drowning person? What's in it for me?
		□ People who help others have happier lives.
○ <b id="kantianism">2.6: <mark>Kantianism: What can be reasoned to be good is morally correct</mark></b>
	§ Categorial Imperatives
		□ First Formulation: You should act only on moral rules that you can imagine everyone else following
            without deriving a logical contradiction.
		□ Second Formulation: Don't use another person.
			® Means to an end
	§ Case For
		□ Treats everyone as moral equals.
		□ Gives everyone moral worth by considering them autonomous beings.
		□ Everyone is held to the same standard.
		□ Produces universal moral guidelines.
	§ Case Against
		□ Sometimes no single rule fully characterizes an action.
		□ Sometimes no way to resolve conflict between rules.
		□ Kantianism allows no exceptions to perfect duties (what you ought to do.)
○ <b id="act_utilitarianism">2.7: <mark>Act Utilitarianism: If an action's good outweighs its harms, it is morally good</mark></b>
	§ Can be measured as pleasure vs pain, happiness vs unhappiness.
	§ Case For
		□ It focuses on happiness
		□ It's practical
		□ It's comprehensive
	§ Case Against
		□ With utilitarian calculus, where do you draw the line?
			® How do you calculate the line? It changes the outcome significantly.
		□ Not practical to put so much energy into every moral decision.
		□ Ignores our innate sense of duty.
		□ We cannot confidently predict the consequences of an action.
		□ Susceptible to moral luck.
			® Bad luck and utilitarianism blames a generous individual when they're just trying to be nice.
○ <b id="rule_utilitarianism">2.8: <mark>Rule Utilitarianism: Whatever moral rules lead to the greatest increase in total happiness
        over all those affect is morally good</mark></b>
	§ Rule Utilitarianism looks at the consequences of an action.
	§ Kantian is looking at the will motivating the action.
	§ Case For
		□ Not every moral decision requires utilitarian calculus.
			® Since rules have been established we can look up.
		□ Exceptional situations do not overthrow moral rules.
		□ Rule utilitarianism solves the problem of moral luck.
		□ Rule utilitarianism reduces the problem of bias.
		□ Appeals to a wide cross section of society.
	§ Case Against
		□ Forces the use of a single scale or measure to measure completely different consequences.
		□ Ignores the problem of unjust distribution of good consequences.
			® See slavery.
○ <b id="social_contract_theory">2.9: <mark>Social Contract Theory: Whatever rules protect against the violence of nature; where everyone
        has equal opportunity; and only the less wealthy can be benefitted at the expense of the more wealthy
        is fair and morally good.</mark></b>
	§ Everyone gets to live in a nice society if they follow the rule.
	§ Case For
		□ Framed in the language of rights.
		□ Based on human nature, recognizing that rational people act in self-interest in the absence of a
            common agreement.
		□ It explains why civil disobedience is morally right.
	§ Case Against
		□ None of us signed the social contract.
		□ Some actions can be characterized in multiple ways.
		□ Does not explain how to solve a moral problem.
		□ May be unjust to those incapable of upholding their side of the contract.
	§ Free rider problem?
○ <b id="virtue_ethics">2.10: <mark>Virtue Ethics: Whatever is the same action that a virtuous person, acting in character, would
        do in the same circumstances is a right action. Whatever virtues and character traits that human
        beings need in order to flourish and be truly happy is morally good.</mark></b>
	§ You can count on a good person to do the right thing at the right time in the right way.
	§ Case For
		□ Makes sense to focus on virtues rather than obligations, rights, or consequences.
		□ Personal relationships can be morally relevant to decision making.
		□ Recognizes that moral decision-making skills develop over time.
		□ Recognizes the important role that emotions play in living a moral life.
	§ Case Against
		□ Different people may have different conceptions of human flourishing.
		□ Cannot be used to guide government policy
		□ Undermines attempts to hold people responsible for their bad actions.
			® They did good before!
			® See Cosby
○ <b id="2.11">2.11: <mark>Comparing Workable Ethical Theories</mark></b>
	§ See chart on page 93
○ <b id="2.12">2.12: <mark>Morality of Breaking the Law</mark></b>
	§ What if we wanted to copy a CD containing copyright music and give it to a friend?
	§ Social Contract Theory: No, doing something nice for a friend does not override moral concern.
	§ Kantian: No, you're failing your obligations as a member of a civil society.
	§ Rule—Utilitarian: No, as we cannot establish the long-term effects of breaking the law will be of
        greater utility.
	§ Act—Utilitarian: Yes, there's $25 of potential benefit of giving it to my friend, and $0 of
        consequences.
		□ Therefore giving it to my hospitalized friend is the right thing to do.
