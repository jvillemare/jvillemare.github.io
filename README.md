# jvillemare.github.io

This is my personal website. It's a little better to see it as intended:

[https://villemarette.me](https://villemarette.me/)

and because I know DNS rules

[https://james.villemarette.me](https://james.villemarette.me/)

**NOTE**: Most of the `/ud/` pages are basic HTML because I like the aesthetic.

## Thanks

 - My parents
